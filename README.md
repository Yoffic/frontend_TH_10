In this project, I needed to build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, I builded the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

My tasks were:
 - Use the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
 - Display at least 3 links that return a list of photos matching some criteria. For example: Dogs, Cats and Coffee.
 - Include a "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
 - Use React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
 - You can use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
 - You should do all data fetching from a container component that passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images
